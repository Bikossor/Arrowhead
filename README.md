# Arrowhead
A vanilla JavaScript helper to parse JSON into CSS.
Formerly known as JOSH.

## Why using Arrowhead?
Arrowhead is a great helper for any web-project which uses CSS. With Arrowhead you can include your CSS either as JSON or as a string right into your HTML or JavaScript without having an additional server-request for your CSS. The result is that you just have to keep track to fewer files and even the performance of your web-project benefits too.

## Getting started

### Requirements
- None

### Installing via npm
```
npm install arrowhead
```

### Installing without npm
- Download the latest release of Arrowhead [here](https://github.com/Bikossor/Arrowhead/releases/latest). Paste Arrowhead into your script and you are done.

### Using Arrowhead with JSON
```html
<script>
  /* Copy Arrowhead in your JavaScript! */

  Arrowhead.parse({
    "#foo": {
      "position": "fixed",
      "top": 0,
      "left": 0,
      "background": "#ddd",
      "width": "100%",
      "height": "4rem"
    },
    ".bar": {
      "color": "red",
      "background": "#808080"
    }
  });
</script>
```

### Using Arrowhead with strings
```html
<script>
  /* Copy Arrowhead in your JavaScript! */

  Arrowhead.parse("#foo{position:fixed;top:0;left:0;background:#ddd;width:100%;height:4rem;}.bar{color:red;background:#808080;}");
</script>
```
